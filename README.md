# Slurm Scripts

This repository hosts a collection of example slurm scripts for use in the lab.
To run a script, you can use the `sbatch` command:

```shell
sbatch <jobscript>
```
For additional information on using Slurm, consult Brown University's high
performance computing cluster documentation found
